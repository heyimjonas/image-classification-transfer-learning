# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

A PyTorch implementation of transfer learning using ResNet18 for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Use a pre-trained ResNet18 model for transfer learning
- Fine-tune the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Implement training and validation loops
- Save the best performing model

## Requirements
